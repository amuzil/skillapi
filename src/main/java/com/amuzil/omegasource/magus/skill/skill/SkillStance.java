/**
 * Name WIP.
 * Functions as a "stance" skill, as described in Avatar's documentation, design, and outline.
 * Stance skills are in between active and passive skills. You have to activate them, but rather than
 * producing a direct effect, they invoke a passive effect upon the player.
 * The idea is to have a cycle method or something similar to rotate through unlocked stances.
 * Stance skills could range from Sun stance firebending, to give access to new combos,
 * to different types of martial arts in a martial arts mod. E.g variations on karate.
